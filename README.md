# NEAT-Flappy_Bird
An AI learns and teaches itself how to play the game flappy bird.

This project entails the creation of a Flappy Bird clone, a popular mobile game, using NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm and Pygame library.

NEAT is an evolutionary algorithm that facilitates the autonomous learning of gameplay. It allows the bird to learn how to play the game on it's own. It evolves neural networks that control the bird's actions, adapting and improving it's performance over time.
